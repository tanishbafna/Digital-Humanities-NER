We were interested in looking at how the emerging merchant class in the restoration era (1660-1700s) exerted its presence in the literature, especially plays, of the time. Restoration literature was written in celebration of Charles II being restored to the throne. We wanted to examine whether there’s a connection between how characters are portrayed (positively or negatively) and their occupation to get a sense of how the merchant class is treated by the authors of the plays selected. Looking at how locations outside of England, especially places which were involved in trade, are portrayed gave us insight into how this emerging class was present in texts that celebrated the Stuart Line. A comparison between early and late restoration plays also gave us an idea on how the attitude towards the merchant class changed over this period.

### Research Hypothesis
The rise of the merchant class is seen to be increasingly positive over the restoration period.

### Our Corpus

The corpus consists of ten plays from the restoration era that were published over a period of forty years. We selected two plays written by Aphra Behn: The Dutch Lover (1673); and The Roundheads (1682). Amboyna (1673) and Aureng-zebe (1675), two plays written by John Dryden are also part of the corpus. The following plays in the corpus were written by William Wycherley, both published in the 1670s. The plays are— The Plain Dealer (1676) and The Gentleman Dancing-Master (1672). Later works from this period include Otway’s Venice Preserv’d (1682); Congreve’s Love for Love (1695) and The Way of the World (1700); and finally Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer (1706). The corpus was created to suit our interest in studying the rich political context of the time and how heavily it might have influenced the literature.

Here’s a final list of the selected texts:

1.  Love for Love: A Comedy - Congreve
2.  The Way of the World - Congreve
3.  The Recruiting Officer - Farquhar
4.  Venice Preserv’d - Otway
5.  The Gentleman-Dancing Mater - Wycherley
6.  The Plain Dealer - Wycherley
7.  Amboyna - Dryden
8.  Aureng-zebe - Dryden
9.  The Dutch Lover - Behn
10. The Roundheads - Behn
